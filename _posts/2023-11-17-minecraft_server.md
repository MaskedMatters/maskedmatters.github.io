# Omega Wars SMP - Configuration Guide

This guide provides instructions for configuring the Omega Wars Minecraft SMP server. Ensure you read through the document for your specific setup.

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) - Essential requirements before configuring the Minecraft Server.
- [Configuring](#configuring) - Instructions for client-side configuration of the Minecraft Server.
- [Postrequisites](#postrequisites) - Information on server configuration, such as turning on/off and accessing logs.

## Prerequisites

### INSTALLING JAVA

New Minecraft mods require the latest version of the `Java Development Kit` (and `Java Runtime Environment`). Download the appropriate version based on your OS.

> *The bundled Java with Minecraft **does not** suffice!* Skip this step if you already have `Java's JDK and JRE` installed.
{: .prompt-warning}

1. [LINUX - Java Installation](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-linux)
2. [MACOS - Java Installation](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-mac)
3. [WINDOWS - Java Installation](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows)

### REQUIRED MODS & INFO

Download the required mods for the Omega Wars SMP server from the [DROPBOX FILES](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/scbtjx4p59ifjman1y1wi/OmegaWARS-SMP_Modpack-1.20.2.zip?rlkey=fzycuuh542zsaov5ulra04trq&dl=0) or use [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/scbtjx4p59ifjman1y1wi/OmegaWARS-SMP_Modpack-1.20.2.zip?rlkey=fzycuuh542zsaov5ulra04trq&dl=0).

### INSTALLING FABRIC & LOCATING .MINECRAFT

Visit [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download the Universal Jar by clicking <kbr>Download Universal Jar</kbr>.

After downloading, open it using the newly installed Java, select the <kbr>Client</kbr> tab, ensure the Minecraft Version is set to 1.20.2, and keep other settings default.

Locate the mods file in the following directories depending on your OS:

- LINUX (FROM ROOT): /home/`USERNAME`/.minecraft
- LINUX (FROM USER): /.minecraft
- WINDOWS (DEFAULT DIR): C:\Users\\`USERNAME`\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

> Windows users, enable Hidden Files in File Explorer by going to view and changing it.

For MacOS users, follow [these steps](#configuring) after revealing hidden folders using terminal commands. It's a pretty complex step to opening hidden files on Mac so you can gladly search the internet or ask in the comments (hopefully) below. 

## Configuring

Once you find your .minecraft folder, add mods by extracting the .zip folder and moving them to the mods folder. Create a mods folder if it doesn't exist.

> If there's no mods folder, create one as needed.
{: .prompt-info}

Open the Fabric profile in the Minecraft Launcher by selecting the profile resembling an old paper scroll. Ensure keybinds, video settings, and music settings are as desired before joining the server.

## Postrequisites

After configuring, join the server. In the WhatsApp group chat, type "I hAvE rEaD eVeRyThInG!!" to receive the server IP (from my NAS).

To manage server settings like accessing logs and turning on/off, please be patient as these instructions are pending.

*Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!* FOR NOW...
