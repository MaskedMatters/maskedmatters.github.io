# iPhone GOT THE MESSAGE

iPhone has finally said they are switching from iMessage to RCS so phone communication can finally be in harmony!

## The Timeline

### SMS & MMS

iPhone has been using outdated messaging technology to talk to Android phones (SMS & MMS)!

SMS is the old way of talking phone to phone. It uses your SIM card data to send your message through the phone towers and aren't safe or encrypted at all.

MMS is just SMS but can do larger files and have support for sending multiple people messages, otherwise known as... a broken groupchat.

### iMessage - Apple Messaging

In 2011, iOS 5 just came out with a new feature, iMessage. iMessage was a way to talk to other iPhones via the internet. It has availability with read receipts, typing indicators and the blue bubble.

### Android Messaging (RCS and before)

Android was created around 2003 and had a goal of making an OS for digital cameras but was later changed to make an OS for smartphones in 2004. After a year, it was aquired by Google in 2005 and most of Android development began then. There first phone was released in 2008 (the HTC Dream) and has later gained popularity among the people.

Android has been using SMS & MMS since 2018 while Apple was still on their iMessage, which at the time was better than Android. Google realized that their outdated messaging system was getting really bad in todays world and because Apple has had WiFi Messaging for 7 years.

> In my opinion, Google has definitely made a mistake when we see that it took 7 years for Google to adopt a new messaging system. Keep in mind though, it took Apple 5 years to switch to RCS since it has been developed and adopted by Google! {: .prompt-info}

Since they needed a new way of communicating they adopted this new messaging system called `RCS`! RCS is an open source communication protocol developed by the GMCA that Apple could've start to use during its production but decided **not to**.

### Apple's RCS Adoption

After 5 years of Apple not adopting RCS, they have finally decided to do it in the next full iOS update in 2024! Apple's "green bubble" is going to be a thing of the past and communication between OS's can now be AMAZING for a long time... I hope.

**What does this mean to you?**

First of all, Apple's green bubble will now be a thing of the past when texting with Android users.

Secondly, **group chats will no longer be broken for iPhone and Android**! Your friends with Android phones will no longer break your groupchats so you can safely add them again. *Please... I really want to be in a group chat*.

Lastly, all of your conversations, no matter iPhone to iPhone or iPhone to Android, will be secure! SMS & MMS won't be used anymore and it would feel just like iMessage, but better!
