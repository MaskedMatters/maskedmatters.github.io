# The Yay Company - Welcome

Hello everyone, this is the new [Yay Company](https://yaycompany.com) website! It is pretty different but hopefully everyone will like it and get the gist. Let's look at some of the changes I've made and how this website works.

## Web Dependencies

### 1. [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)

Cloudflare is my new domain configuration service and DNS. It's a very reputable company and has great DDoS protection. They are also the "protectors" of the IP address 1.1.1.1! They filter out all of the bad stuff that goes to it (like 1.1.1.1 being used in examples and just pinging it to verify computer stuff).

### 2. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

Github Pages is my new server where all the code and markdown is stored. It's free, made by Github, and so easy to use! They are also the owners of this new static website generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)! Jekyll is a really important part in my website whick we'll talk about in the next section.

### 3. Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator that interprets markdown code so it can be displayed on a website like this. Markdown is also a really cool way of displaying documents.

Here is an example:

```markdown

## GUI Changes

**What do these new dependencies mean to you?**

Well, we still have the pages bar on the left side of the webpage but with different stuff.

1. Home - The Home tab will contain all my new projects and posts for my home lab. The posts are organized from newest to oldest so you can always stay up to date.

2. Categories - The Categories tab shows all of the different posts organized in folders and subfolders. This post is under the <kbd>Getting Started</kbd> folder and is called <kbd>The Yay Company - Welcome</kbd>

3. Tags - The Tags tab shows all the different tags that the posts go to so you can search easier

4. Archives - The Archives tab shows all the posts in chronological order to make it even easier easier to search.

5. About Me - Last but not least, we have the About Me tab! This is just like previous About Me tab but looks so much better.

## Final Thoughts

In my opinion, this is a giant step in THE YAY COMPANY history! I hope you guys like it and feel free to share your thoughts in the comment section (that hopefully works)!
